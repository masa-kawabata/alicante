	Besides the normal programming classes, I have also found interest in website design after taking CSC170, which is an awesome course to introduce the world of web design.  During this class, I have learned so much about CSS,HTML and JS. I have also learned how to put these components together and make them a workable website. After that, I decided to add computer science as my minor and continue to build up more knowledge about web design by taking more advanced classes like csc174.
