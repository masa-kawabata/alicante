				I have been living in Beijing, the capital of China for the past 15 years and it is my first years living in U.S. My first language is Chinese, but the first language I learnt is Cantonese, even though I already forget everything. When I was small, I was sent to the south and then set back to Beijing. Beijing is a gigantic city full of spectaculars. You can see the relic of the ancient empire standing in between metropolitan skyscrapers. You can taste authentic local food from all over the China, since 70% of its population are originally none-Beijingers. You can compete with the “people mountain people sea” in every corner within the five transportation circles. Growing up in Beijing, I was deeply influenced by its personality—unsettled, always craving for change and refinement, open to new.
