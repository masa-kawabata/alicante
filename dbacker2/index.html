	<h2> Introduction</h2>

	<p>Hello, my name is David Backer and I am a senior and a Digital Media Studies Major at the University of Rochester. In addition to being a student, I also have passion for music, film and television, and video games. I’m interested in articulation, or the ways in which a message can be delivered from person to person. To this end, DMS appeals to me as a means to study how people interact with different delivery systems.</p>

	<p>The rest of the pages on this website detail my academic career from the end of highschool to the end of sophomore year, and detail the story of how I discovered the field of Digital Media Studies and decided to pursue it.</p>
