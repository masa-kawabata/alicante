			<p>Here in University of Rochester, there’s not as many things to do as in Beijing. Rochester is a quite, small, peaceful, nice little town for me, even though my former roommate from upstate New York told me it is actually a “city”. I did manage to some jobs to do by fortune. I am working as a teaching assistant in CSC170, and a note-taker in AME294 this semester. I never had a job here before. In Beijing, I used to teach and take care kids from high school and primary school. I never had a job which is not related to education, though I really would love to be a coffee shop owner deeply inside my heart. I believe in a way every job merits equally, regardless how many people you serve, what you do, how many dollars float. Because what really matters is that you gain a sense of achievement and respect yourself.
