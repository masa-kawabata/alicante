## Ontology:

Headers for each student's names
Navigation tags that will bring you to the each student's website.
Our website is presented in the following categories, "Personal", "Jobs" and "Academics".
Three students will have the categories in the same order.

Personal: Stories about themselves before entering University of Rochester, where the students are from and fun facts about themselves. 

Jobs: Previous jobs that they have worked or experienced - what they have learned from their jobs and explain the description of their jobs. 

Academics: Classes and intended majors of that they are studying at the University of Rochester. 

## Taxonomy: 
We make sure that the website title (h1) is the student's name to make sure the reader knows what page they are in. 

Each paragraphs in categories make sense with the topic they are in. 

Navigation bar will make sure to indicate what webpage they are currently visiting.

The navigation tags are ordered alphabetically by student's first names. 

## Choreography 

This website is organized alphebetically by student's first names. 

The reason why the topics ("Personal" "Jobs" "Academics") are not in alphabetical order is because the order goes in historical order. 

All of the students talk about their past life before Rochester in personal tag, and I thought it makes sense to put "Personal" category behind "Jobs" and "Academics".
